tidyverse works with some packages and conflicts with others
see this section for a detailed list

ggplot::ggplot() tells yout explicity that ggplot() function is from the ggplot 2 package

we looked over this example in class, see my class notes for better details.

```{r}
require(ggplot2)
require(tidyverse)
ggplot2::mpg
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth()

ggplot() + 
  geom_point(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_smooth(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```
